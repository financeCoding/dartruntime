// --- Handles ---

/**
 * An object reference managed by the Dart VM garbage collector.
 *
 * Because the garbage collector may move objects, it is unsafe to
 * refer to objects directly. Instead, we refer to objects through
 * handles, which are known to the garbage collector and updated
 * automatically when the object is moved. Handles should be passed
 * by value (except in cases like out-parameters) and should never be
 * allocated on the heap.
 *
 * Most functions in the Dart Embedding API return a handle. When a
 * function completes normally, this will be a valid handle to an
 * object in the Dart VM heap. This handle may represent the result of
 * the operation or it may be a special valid handle used merely to
 * indicate successful completion. Note that a valid handle may in
 * some cases refer to the null object.
 *
 * When a function encounters a problem that prevents it from
 * completing normally, it returns an error handle (See Dart_IsError).
 * An error handle has an associated error message that gives more
 * details about the problem (See Dart_GetError).
 *
 * When an unhandled exception occurs, it is returned as an error
 * handle that has additional information about the exception (See
 * Dart_ErrorHasException). This error handle retains information
 * about the exception and the stack trace (See
 * Dart_ErrorGetException, Dart_ErrorGetStacktrace,
 * Dart_RethrowException).
 *
 * Local handles are allocated within the current scope (see
 * Dart_EnterScope) and go away when the current scope exits. Unless
 * otherwise indicated, callers should assume that all functions in
 * the Dart embedding api return local handles.
 *
 * Persistent handles are allocated within the current isolate. They
 * can be used to store objects across scopes. Persistent handles have
 * the lifetime of the current isolate unless they are explicitly
 * deallocated (see Dart_DeletePersistentHandle).
